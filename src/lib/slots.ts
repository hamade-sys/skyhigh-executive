/**
 * Airport slot bidding system (PRD slot mechanic).
 *
 * Each airport has a finite number of weekly schedule slots. Slots are
 * awarded via end-of-quarter blind-bid auction:
 *  - Players submit bids of (airport, slots wanted, price/slot) any time.
 *  - At end of quarter, bids are sorted by price descending and slots are
 *    awarded to the highest bidder until `available` is exhausted.
 *  - Unsold slots roll forward. Each Q4/Q8/Q12/Q16 the airport opens a new
 *    batch of slots based on its tier.
 *
 * 1 weekly schedule = 1 slot at each endpoint (origin + destination).
 * So a 13/week route consumes 13 slots at origin AND 13 at destination.
 *
 * Tier targets per PRD user spec:
 *  - Tier 1 starts 200, ends ~1000 (40Q × ~40/Q = ~800 added)
 *  - Tier 2 starts 250, ends ~750 (~125/year added)
 *  - Tier 3 starts 50, ends ~300 (~63/year added)
 *  - Tier 4 (PRD doesn't specify, modelled as half of Tier 3)
 *
 * Pricing per PRD:
 *  - Tier 2 base = $80K
 *  - Tier 1 = $80K × 1.5 = $120K (50% premium)
 *  - Tier 3 = $80K × 0.5 = $40K (50% cheaper)
 *  - Tier 4 = $20K

 *    Slot at 43% of route cost; fuel at 3%. Inverted vs real-world.
 *
 *  Round 1 (May 2026 first pass): T1 $10K / T2 $7K / T3 $3K / T4 $1.5K
 *    Slot at ~15% of cost; fuel at ~8%. User flag: "8% on fuel is
 *    still very low... considering this is not discounted wholesale
 *    fuel."
 *
 *  Round 2 (May 2026 second pass): T1 $5K / T2 $3.5K / T3 $1.5K / T4 $750
 *    Cut another 50%. Combined with fuel burn factor 1.6 → 2.5, the
 *    cost mix now targets: fuel ~13-15% · slot ~6-8% · staff ~22% ·
 *    maintenance ~16% · hub ~7% · rest ~30%. Slot is still 2-3× the
 *    real-world industry share (3-5%) but the gap is acceptable —
 *    workshop participants need slot bidding to be a meaningful lever
 *    in the strategy game, and a too-cheap slot model removes that
 *    tension.
 *
 *  Anchor reference: Heathrow's published recurring slot rent is
 *  ~$100K/year. T2 at $3.5K/wk = ~$182K/year per slot — 1.8× the
 *  real anchor. T1 hubs like JFK are nominally more expensive in
 *  reality so 2.7× makes sense at the top tier.
